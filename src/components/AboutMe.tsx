            Hi there 👋
            <br />
            I’m Ayaka Kojima. I have 8 years of experience as a Front-End Developer and UI Designer. I combine beauty
            and function to create digital products. My expertise also helps design and development teams work together,
            which leads to strong and successful results.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I’m not coding, I love exploring new design ideas, experimenting with new tools and technologies, and
            finding creative ways to improve how users interact.
            <br />
            <br />
            Outside of work, I enjoy sketching, watching movies, and practicing martial arts like MMA and Brazilian
            Jiu-Jitsu.
            <br />
            And of course, I love spending time with my cat 🐱 <br />
            He is perfect coding partner!
